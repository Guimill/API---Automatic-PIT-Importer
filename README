This is a application running with Powershell and OSGeo4W that automatized boring and time consumming tasks.
I developped it on Powershell because it is powerfull in files / directories editing.
I used OSGEO4W because it is used by all my colleagues through QGIS and because of the office policies, we haven't got the right to install any code libraries/dependencies and to ask for admin rights.
So this way, API is able to run on every computer of the office.

It basecally, unzip, create concatenate fields, create csv, empty some fields, do left joins in new csv, then clean the manipulation on the shapefiles and rezip them.
